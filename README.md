### Description:

This is my solution for the Free Code Camp Portfolio project. The project was completed using the legacy requirements which were significantly simpler than the current requirements and they are as follows:

  1. Can access all of the content by scrolling
  2. Can click different buttons that take the user to various social media sites 
  3. Can go to different sections via a nav bar
	4. Can see thumbnails of the different projects done 

Most requirements have been met although numerous improvements can be made. These improvements range from simple fixes in the code or process improvements. The latter, I might upload/ post a link to a write up at some point.

### Built with:
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome Icons
- Google Fonts
