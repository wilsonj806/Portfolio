# How I Upgraded My Portfolio
Hey, so if you're reading this, that means my new portfolio is up in some way shape or form. It's light on content for now, but this is wildly preferable to what I had before. This article is a short run down on the upgrade process.

## What Was v2.0.0?
Before we can get into the nitty gritty of how I upgraded my portfolio, I feel it's important to go over the old portfolio. The old portfolio was a static site built with plain HTML and Sass hosted on Github Pages. I made it mobile first, and I tried to make the project highlights as easy and quick of a browsing experience as possible.

Design-wise, I had a full research, mockup, iterate process and the end result, while simple, was pretty good.

Since it was entirely static assets, it was quite a lot of work to update the portfolio with new content or pages so that fell off very quickly.
